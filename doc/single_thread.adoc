* <<spreadsort>> is an extremely fast hybrid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort[Radix Sort] algorithm, designed and developed by Steven Ross.
* _pdqsort_ is a improvement of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort[Quicksort] algorithm, designed and developed by Orson Peters.
* _spinsort_ is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability[stable] sort that is fast with random or nearly sorted data,
  designed and developed by Francisco Tapia.
* _flat_stable_sort_ is a stable sort that uses very little additional memory (around 1% of the size of the data), providing 80% - 90% of the speed of
 spinsort, designed and developed by Francisco Tapia.
