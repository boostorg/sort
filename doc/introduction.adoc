== Introduction

The goal of the Boost Sort Library is provide to the users, the most modern, fast, and memory-efficient sorting algorithms.

This library provides stable and unstable sorting algorithms, in single threaded and parallel versions.

These algorithms do not use any other library or utility, you only need to include ``boost/sort/sort.hpp``
or one of the more specific headers.  The parallel algorithms need a C++11 compliant compiler.

* <<spreadsort>> is an extremely fast hybrid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort[Radix Sort] algorithm, designed and developed by Steven Ross.
* _pdqsort_ is a improvement of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort[Quicksort] algorithm, designed and developed by Orson Peters.
* _spinsort_ is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability[stable] sort that is fast with random or nearly sorted data,
  designed and developed by Francisco Tapia.
* _flat_stable_sort_ is a stable sort that uses very little additional memory (around 1% of the size of the data), providing 80% - 90% of the speed of
 spinsort, designed and developed by Francisco Tapia.

=== Parallel Algorithms

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Algorithm             | Stable |   Additional memory      | Best case | Average case | Worst case

| sample_sort           |   yes  |        stem:[n]          | stem:[n]  | stem:[n \log n] | stem:[n \log n]
| parallel_stable_sort  |   yes  |      stem:[n/2]          | stem:[n]  | stem:[n \log n] | stem:[n \log n]
| block_indirect_sort   |   no   | block_size * num_threads | stem:[n]  | stem:[n \log n] | stem:[n \log n]
|===

* _Sample_sort_ is a implementation of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samplesort[Samplesort] algorithm done by Francisco Tapia.
* _Parallel_stable_sort_ is based on the samplesort algorithm, but using a half of the memory used by sample_sort, conceived and implemented by Francisco Tapia.
* _Block_indirect_sort_ is a novel high-speed parallel sort algorithm with low additional memory consumption, conceived and implemented by Francisco Tapia.

The *block_size* is an internal parameter of the algorithm, which in order to achieve the
highest speed, changes according to the size of the objects to sort according to the next table. The strings use a block_size of 128.
